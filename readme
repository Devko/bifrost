dynamicly configured reverse proxy
by l.a.v.

This program was not tested well so use at your own risk! I am not responsible for any kind of damage anyone will revieve from it!

This is a plain reverse proxy which updates it's routing table from configuration file over specific periods of time. All configurations are in json encoded file, by default ./config.json, although you can specify different one :
    bifrost -c /path/to/config

Example syntax of configuration file :

{
    "addr": ":80",
    "refresh": 5,
    "proxy_table": {
            "/" : ["http://google.com/"]
        }
}

    addr - address to listen on (default ":80"), the only field which is not updated dynamically!
    refresh - time period in seconds, over which configuration file is re-read. Not required, but there'll be a lot of spam in log if you don't specify it
    proxy_table - routing table in format of map[string][]string. Urls' matching is the same as in Go's net/http package. All urls specified for given pattern are used sequentially for routing. This is the only required parameter.

Each destination url in routing table should specify protocol and path, otherwise it will fail to route or will be ignored.
